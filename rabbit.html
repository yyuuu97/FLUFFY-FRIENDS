                    <h2>Netherland Dwarf Rabbit</h2>
                    <p>Price: RM600-RM1000</p>
                    <p>
                        The Netherland Dwarf is a breed of domestic rabbit that originated in the Netherlands. Weighing 1.1–2.5 pounds (0.50–1.13 kg), the Netherland Dwarf is one of the smallest rabbit breeds. Its popularity as a pet or show rabbit may stem from its neotenic appearance. The Netherland Dwarf is recognised by both the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) and the British Rabbit Council (BRC). The Netherland Dwarf is often confused with the Polish breed of rabbit, but the latter has longer ears, a non-brachycephalic head and less cobbiness.

                        Lop rabbit or lop-eared rabbit refers to any rabbit with ears that droop, as opposed to being carried erect. A number of rabbit breeds are characterized by such lop ears. Abnormalities in the skull of a half-lop rabbit were studied by Charles Darwin in 1868.

                    <p>Price: RM200-RM330</p>
                    <p>
                        The Angora rabbit, which is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, is bred for the long fibers of its coat, known as Angora wool, which are gathered by shearing, combing or plucking. Because rabbits do not possess the same allergy-causing qualities as many other animals, their wool is an important alternative. There are at least 11 distinct breeds of Angora rabbit, four of which are currently recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA)：English Angora, French Angora, Giant Angora and Satin Angora. Others include German Angora, Chinese Angora, Finnish Angora, Japanese Angora, Korean Angora, Russian Angora, St Lucian Angora and Swiss Angora.

                        The extrusion process improves feed digestibility and nutrient utilization. This high quality extruded form slows the rate of feed intake and reduces fines in the feed resulting in reduced digestive and respiratory disorders.

                        Alfalfa, also known as alfalfa, is a perennial flowering plant of the legume family, the legume family. It is grown as an important feed crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay and silage, as well as green manure and cover crops. In the later stages of maturity, the leaflets are elongated. It has a cluster of small purple flowers followed by two to three spiral fruits containing 10 to 20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warm temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock feed since at least ancient Greek and Roman times.
